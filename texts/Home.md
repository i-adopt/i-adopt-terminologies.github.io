This repository contains terminologies to compose semantic variable descriptions as proposed by the [RDA InteroperAble Descriptions of Observable Property Terminology WG](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/interoperable-descriptions-observable-property-terminology-wg-i-adopt-wg).
It was seeded with the data gathered during the WGs lifespan and is continuously maintained at github since then.

The current version of the ontology can be found at [w3id.org/iadopt/](https://w3id.org/iadopt/).
